Task0 # 
runtime: 0(1)
reason:
Each line doesn't change according to an input and is constant time
Total time would be 11 * 0(1) = 0(11) 
Dropping the constant is 0(1)

Task1 # 
runtime: 0(n)
reason:
There is a for loop with opperations of constant time 0(1). The for loop is 
a runtime of 0(n) and dominates the runtime.
Total time would be 4 * 0(1) + n * 0(6)
Dropping the constants is 0(1) + 0(n)
Dropping constants futher is 0(n)

Task2 # 
runtime: 0(n)
reason:
There is a for loop with opperations of constant time 0(1). The for loop is 
a runtime of 0(n) and dominates the runtime.
Total time would be 4 * 0(1) + n * 0(11)
Dropping the constants is 0(1) + 0(n)
Dropping constants futher is 0(n)

Task3 # 
runtime: 0(n log n)
reason:
The sort method's runtime is 0(n log n) so it dominates the runtime.
Total time would be 5 * 0(1) + n * 0(9) + n * 0(1) + n * 0(n log n)
Dropping the constants is 0(1) + 0(n) + 0(n log n)

Task4 # 
runtime: 0(n log n)
reason:
The sort method's runtime is 0(n log n) so it dominates the runtime.
Total time would be 4 * 0(1) + n * 0(4) + n * 0(4) + n * 0(1) + n * 0(n log n)
Dropping the constants is 0(1) + 0(n) + 0(n log n)
