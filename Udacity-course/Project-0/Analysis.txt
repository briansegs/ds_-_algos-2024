Task0 # 
runtime: 0(1)
reason:
Each line doesn't change according to an input and is constant time
Total time would be 11 * 0(1) = 0(11) 
Dropping the constant is 0(1)

Task1 # 
runtime: 0(n)
reason:
There is a for loop with opperations of constant time 0(1). The for loop is 
a runtime of 0(n) and dominates the runtime.
Total time would be 4 * 0(1) + n * 0(6)
Dropping the constants is 0(1) + 0(n)
Dropping constants futher is 0(n)

Task2 # 
runtime: 0(n^2)
reason:
There is a for loop with opperations of constant time 0(1) and linear time 0(n). This would make the runtime 0(n^2).
Total time would be 4 * 0(1) + n * 0(5) * (n * 0(4) + n * 0(4))
Dropping the constants is 0(1) + 0(n) * 0(n)
Dropping constants futher is 0(n^2)

Task3 # 
runtime: 0(n log n) or 0(n^2)
reason:
The sort method's runtime is 0(n log n) so it dominates the runtime unless the .startswith() method is a runtime of 0(n). Then the dominate runtime would be 0(n^2). I cant find the runtime of .startswith().


Task4 # 
runtime: 0(n^2)
reason:
The runtime for in / not in list/array methods is linear O(n). Because these are used in loops that would be 0(n) * 0(n) or 0(n^2).
